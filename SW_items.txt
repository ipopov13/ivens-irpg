A patch suitable for the win will include:
- Renaming items/types to SWC appropriate things (we don't have gloves and rings and shit), this requires changing the bot's perl source code
- Add/modify unique items (name after famous characters, your favorite server admin, etc.)
- Change hardcoded game text (hand of god, alignment strings, etc.) to a SW/SWC theme
- Update/rename the events and quests (in events.txt)
- Tongue-in-cheek references and star wars humor or in-jokes are encouraged
